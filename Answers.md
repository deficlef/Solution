# Test Questions and Answers

##### How could you make the taxi license cost calculator more valuable for customers?

The taxi license cost calculator could be made
more valuable by adding a user account feature,
where user's could save their details,
so as to avoid customer's having to repeat
the process whenever using the service.

It could be developed to operate in different languages,
to be more inclusive of the multi-cultural community.

A web version with a more user-friendly UI could be developed,
so customers could have access from anywhere at anytime.

The Final calculations could also be saved to
customers' accounts, allowing customers view,
print and compare previous calculations, as can be
seen on sites like moneysupermarket.com.

Information such as the actual amount saved per discount,
could be displayed as well in the final calculations. This would help customers
immediately see how much savings each discount offers.


##### What is your preferred test framework and why?

I like using Codeception because of how easy it is to use, setup and maintain.
For acceptance tests, it utilises a simple syntax that is easy to remember.
Out of all the other test frameworks I've used i.e. JUnit, PHPUnit and Esspresso,
I feel it has the advantage of being a one stop shop for all my development tests, covering unit tests,
API tests and GUI testing via Selenium e.t.c. all in one place.


##### How would you speed up the process of turning business ideas into features that customers can use?

Business ideas would be divided into smaller stories
that are clearly defined and focus on specific areas. The stories would then be
developed in an AGILE method, enabling the delivery
of individual stories that are fully tested and functional.
This would allow customers to have working features that can be used,
while the rest of the project is being developed.
This process would be iterated on all the stories until all aspects of the business idea have been fully implemented.

##### How would you go about developing a new feature as part of an agile team?

As a team, we would divide the feature into smaller stories that focus on specific aspects of the overall.
We would then develop these stories across a number of sprints,
using sprint plannings to decide what stories to work on and whether they are achievable in the sprint length.

For each sprint, all selected stories would undergo the full software development life cycle, which involves
developing and testing via unit, acceptance and
functional tests, fixing any bugs we find along the way. We would also hold daily stand ups to catch up on previous day's work,
discuss issues being faced, and tasks for the current day.

At the end of each sprint, we would be having fully developed, well tested stories that add to the overall feature.
Stories that could not be completed would then be re-accessed in the next sprint planning.
Retrospective meetings would be conducted to discuss how each sprint went, lessons learnt and areas of improvement going forward.

We would keep iterating this process until we have developed all created stories for the feature.

##### What is the difference between unit and acceptance testing?

Unit testing involves testing the full behaviour
of the smallest testable parts of an application,
to ensure that all units behave as expected whereas
acceptance testing is a test carried out by a business
or user to ensure that the system meets their needs,
requirements and processes.

With unit tests, developers can
see where their code is failing while acceptance test let's developers
know whether or not they have met the requirements of the business.
